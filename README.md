> ## Problem Domain

### **Virtual Store Phase 4**

An e-commerce storefront that uses React with Redux:

- Detail pages for individual products, and cart checkout page

---

- Visually appealing site, styled with [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- Redux Store manages the state of categories and products in the store
- Categories and products are retrieved from an API, using `thunk` to enable asynchronous actions
- When the user selects a category, that category's products are displayed
- Products can be added to cart and removed from cart
  - Cart count and inventory counts both update
