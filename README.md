> ## Problem Domain

### **Virtual Store Phase 3**

An e-commerce storefront that uses React with Redux:

- Categories and products are retrieved from an API, using `thunk` to enable asynchronous actions

---

- Shopping cart that allows products to be added to cart, and deleted
  - cart count and inventory counts update

---

- Visually appealing site, styled with [Material UI](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/installation/)
- Redux Store manages the state of categories and products in the store
- List of categories displayed (with state data)
- When the user selects a category:
  - That category is selected, and
  - That category's products are displayed
